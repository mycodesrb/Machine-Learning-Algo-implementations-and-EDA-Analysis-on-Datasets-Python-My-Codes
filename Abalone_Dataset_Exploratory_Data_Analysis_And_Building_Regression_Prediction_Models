# In this analysis, I have done the exploratory analysis on Abalone Dataset. Post that I tested the scores for different 
# Regression Algorithms.
# Dataset can be found on https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php

# Data Set Information:

# Predicting the age of abalone from physical measurements. The age of abalone is determined by cutting the shell through 
# the cone, staining it, and counting the number of rings through a microscope -- a boring and time-consuming task. Other
# measurements, which are easier to obtain, are used to predict the age. Further information, such as weather patterns and 
# location (hence food availability) may be required to solve the problem.

#Sex / nominal / -- / M, F, and I (infant)
#Length / continuous / mm / Longest shell measurement
#Diameter / continuous / mm / perpendicular to length
#Height / continuous / mm / with meat in shell
#Whole weight / continuous / grams / whole abalone
#Shucked weight / continuous / grams / weight of meat
#Viscera weight / continuous / grams / gut weight (after bleeding)
#Shell weight / continuous / grams / after being dried
#Rings / integer / -- / +1.5 gives the age in years

# from the above plots, we can see that the normal spread is spread in the range of 2Standard Deviation approximately

# Min: 9.933684-2*3.224169 = 3.485346....above box plot shows this fact

# We plot the parameters related to the dimension: Length, Diameter and Height
sb.pairplot(df[['Length','Diameter','Height']])
# Here we see that Height is showing some outliers, so let us check for outliers

# Try to see the outliers in Height

# To better visualize the distribution, we cut the x limits to the major spread of height

# From the above plot we observed that the shell weight and the diameter remains concentrated below certain level till the
# the ring size of 5 and starts increasing with ring value 5. Further more, with larger values of ring, these two parameters
# start dispersing

# Let us check how the correlation varies with the number of rings
# Ring size 0 to 10 shows a different pattern as compared to above ring size > 10
# Let us visualize the corelation in these two segments

# From the above plots, it is clear that the Abalons increase in dimension and weight till the ring size of 10 but after the 
# ring size of 10 to 11, it shows spreading or dispersing pattern so we can say that after ring size of 10 to 11, the development 
# in size and weight depends on environmental factors, which has no significant pattern

# Now let us examine the SEX w.r.t Ring size
# Sex: Thres categories are found : Male, Female and Infant(Which are not adult)
